# CNN Image Classification using Julia

### Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, specifically focusing on classifying different types of skin lesions. The project is implemented in Julia and leverages deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in diagnosing various skin conditions.
### Significance of Models
Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, have immense significance in medical diagnostics. They enable computers to interpret images similarly to humans, which is crucial for early disease detection. For instance, mobile applications using deep learning can diagnose skin lesions for cancerous changes, aiding in the early detection of skin cancer. Additionally, AI can diagnose rare genetic diseases by analyzing facial images, significantly reducing the time needed to detect unusual mutations.
### Origin and Evolution
Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, relies on deep neural networks to model complex patterns in data. The technology has evolved significantly since the 1950s, with major breakthroughs such as the backpropagation algorithm in 1986 and the use of CNNs in the 2012 ImageNet competition. These advancements have enabled the development of more complex architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and GANs, expanding the applications of deep learning across various fields.
